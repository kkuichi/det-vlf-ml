## Analysis of relationship between VLF signal noise reduction and small period wave excitations and seismic activity using machine learning techniques

This study examines the relationship between very low frequency (VLF) signal noise reduction and small period wave excitations, and seismic activity by applying machine learning to VLF signal amplitude measurements. The problem is formulated as a binary classification task distinguishing earthquake-related intervals from non-seismic periods using features extracted from both time and frequency domains. Time-domain models achieve moderate performance, with Support Vector Machines performing best (AUC = 0.76). In contrast, frequency-domain features markedly improve discriminability: spectral components in the 0.2–6 second range achieve F1-scores up to 0.89 and AUC values up to 0.94, while longer-period features remain informative but slightly less effective. The results provide empirical evidence that VLF radio signal variations encode possible seismic-related signatures and demonstrate the value of spectral analysis and machine learning for early characterization of earthquake-associated VLF signal anomalies.
